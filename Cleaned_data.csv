Word embeddings are a type of natural language processing technique used to represent words in a numerical format, called a vector. The idea behind word embeddings is to capture the meaning of words based on the context in which they appear. This allows the model to understand the similarity and relationships between words, even if they have never seen them before.

Word2Vec is a popular method for creating word embeddings. It uses a neural network to learn the vector representation of words by predicting the surrounding context words given a target word. The neural network is trained on a large corpus of text, and the resulting word vectors are used to represent words in the corpus.

The resulting word vectors have several properties that make them useful for many natural language processing tasks, such as text classification, machine translation, and language modeling.

Principal component analysis (PCA) is a popular technique for analyzing large datasets containing a high number of dimensions/features per observation, increasing the interpretability of data while preserving the maximum amount of information, and enabling the visualization of multidimensional data. Formally, PCA is a statistical technique for reducing the dimensionality of a dataset. This is accomplished by linearly transforming the data into a new coordinate system where (most of) the variation in the data can be described with fewer dimensions than the initial data. Many studies use the first two principal components in order to plot the data in two dimensions and to visually identify clusters of closely related data points. Principal component analysis has applications in many fields such as population genetics, microbiome studies, and atmospheric science.","['yt:cc=on', 'pca tutorial', 'pca dimensionality reduction', 'pca practical tutorials', 'principal component analysis', 'covariance matrix', 'pca in machine learning', 'what is pca', 'dimensionality reduction']",2023-01-18 06:31:13+00:00,15546,458,31.0,PT1H28M31S,Wednesday,5311.0

jLcuVu5xdDo,Complete RoadMap To Learn Computer Vision,"In this video we are going to dicuss about the complete roadmap to learn computer vision with help of amazing libraries like opencv, python, tensorflow.
Computer vision is a subfield of Artificial Intelligence which aims to make machines intelligent enough to understand images. As Machine learning (and deep learning) is one of the most active subsets of AI on the planet nowadays, it would be appropriate and sensible to tackle computer vision in a Machine learning framework. To understand the full essence of my to-be-suggested roadmap, it’s important to consider a general machine learning process

HZ9MUzCRlzI,Implementing Machine Learninng Pipelines USsing Sklearn And Python,"github: https://github.com/krishnaik06/Pipeline-MAchine-Learning
Pipeline of transforms with a final estimator.

Sequentially apply a list of transforms and a final estimator. Intermediate steps of the pipeline must be ‘transforms’, that is, they must implement fit and transform methods. The final estimator only needs to implement fit. The transformers in the pipeline can be cached using memory argument.

The purpose of the pipeline is to assemble several steps that can be cross-validated together while setting different parameters. For this, it enables setting parameters of the various steps using their names and the parameter name separated by a '__', as in the example below. A step’s estimator may be replaced entirely by setting the parameter with its name to another estimator, or a transformer removed by setting it to 'passthrough' or None.

015vL0cJfA0,Visualizing High Dimension Data Using UMAP Is A Piece Of Cake Now,"Google colab link: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1jV4kOHbpdu0Zc7Ml18kdxaQJxV81vB21?usp=sharing
UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection) is a novel
manifold learning technique for dimension reduction. UMAP is constructed
from a theoretical framework based in Riemannian geometry and algebraic
topology. the result is a practical scalable algorithm that is applicable to
real world data. UMAP algorithm is competitive with t-SNE for visualization quality, and arguably preserves more of the global structure with
superior run time performance. Furthermore, UMAP has no computational
restrictions on embedding dimension, making it viable as a general purpose
dimension reduction technique for machine learning

k2pofjdxkZ8,DSA Series-Lets Become a Pro In Queues Data Structures,"A Queue is a linear structure which follows a particular order in which the operations are performed. The order is First In First Out (FIFO). A good example of a queue is any queue of consumers for a resource where the consumer that came first is served first. The difference between stacks and queues is in removing. In a stack we remove the item the most recently added; in a queue, we remove the item the least recently added.

A3Xx8qaH8CQ,DSA Series-Lets Become a Pro In Stacks Data Structures,"Stack is a linear data structure which follows a particular order in which the operations are performed. The order may be LIFO(Last In First Out) or FILO(First In Last Out).
There are many real-life examples of a stack. Consider an example of plates stacked over one another in the canteen. The plate which is at the top is the first one to be removed, i.e. the plate which has been placed at the bottommost position remains in the stack for the longest period of time. So, it can be simply seen to follow LIFO(Last In First Out)/FILO(First In Last Out) order.

The stored procedure is a prepared SQL query that you can save so that the query can be reused over and over again. So, if the user has an SQL query that you write over and over again, keep it as a stored procedure and execute it. Users can also pass parameters to a stored procedure so that the stored procedure can act based on the parameter value that is given.

xDDlB51dX5E,Tutorial 6- Indexing In MySQL-MySQL Complete Playlist,"CREATE INDEX statement in SQL is used to create indexes in tables. 
The indexes are used to retrieve data from the database more quickly than others.
The user can not see the indexes, and they are just used to speed up queries /searches.
Note: Updating the table with indexes takes a lot of time than updating a table without indexes.
It is because the indexes also need an update. 
So, only create indexes on those columns that will be frequently searched against.

TH8ntzkdtLk,What Is Smart Contract In Ethereum Blockchain?,"""smart contract"" is simply a program that runs on the Ethereum blockchain. It's a collection of code (its functions) and data (its state) that resides at a specific address on the Ethereum blockchain.
Smart contracts are a type of Ethereum account. This means they have a balance and they can send transactions over the network. However they're not controlled by a user, instead they are deployed to the network and run as programmed. User accounts can then interact with a smart contract by submitting transactions that execute a function defined on the smart contract. Smart contracts can define rules, like a regular contract, and automatically enforce them via the code. Smart contracts cannot be deleted by default, and interactions with them are irreversible.

0JuRzN6T70I,Tutorial 1- What Is Blockchain?,"KEY TAKEAWAYS
Blockchain is a specific type of database.
It differs from a typical database in the way it stores information; blockchains store data in blocks that are then chained together. 
As new data comes in it is entered into a fresh block. Once the block is filled with data it is chained onto the previous block, which makes the data chained together in chronological order.
Different types of information can be stored on a blockchain but the most common use so far has been as a ledger for transactions. 
In Bitcoin’s case, blockchain is used in a decentralized way so that no single person or group has control—rather, all users collectively retain control.
Decentralized blockchains are immutable, which means that the data entered is irreversible. For Bitcoin, this means that transactions are permanently recorded and viewable to anyone.

Code: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/10Z5fsjKPNqyaI9qMo-mgHb6i9l--Roye?usp=sharing
darts is a Python library for easy manipulation and forecasting of time series. It contains a variety of models, from classics such as ARIMA to deep neural networks. The models can all be used in the same way, using fit() and predict() functions, similar to scikit-learn. The library also makes it easy to backtest models, and combine the predictions of several models and external regressors. Darts supports both univariate and multivariate time series and models. The neural networks can be trained on multiple time series, and some of the models offer probabilistic forecasts.","['yt:cc=on', 'krish naik machine learning', 'krish naik deep learning', 'darts library', 'time series forecasting']",2021-09-25 15:38:20+00:00,39988,1210,79.0,PT11M37S,Saturday,697.0

In this tutorial, we will show you how to fine-tune a pretrained model from the Transformers library. In TensorFlow, models can be directly trained using Keras and the fit method. In PyTorch, there is no generic training loop so the 🤗 Transformers library provides an API with the class Trainer to let you fine-tune or train a model from scratch easily.

y9AK1YKRoLg,Complete Road Map Towards Data Science In 2021,"According to the Harvard Business Review, Data Scientist is “The Sexiest Job of the 21st Century”. Is this not enough to know more about data science! In the world of data space, the era of Big Data emerged when organizations are dealing with petabytes and exabytes of data. It became very tough for industries for the storage of data until 2010. Now when popular frameworks like Hadoop and others solved the problem of storage, the focus is on processing the data. And here Data Science plays a big role. Nowadays the growth of data science has been increased in various ways and so one should be ready for the future by learning what data science is and how can we add value to it.

Model validation helps in ensuring that the model performs well on new data, and helps in selecting the best model, the parameters, and the accuracy metrics.

In this guide, we will learn the basics and implementation of several model validation techniques, mentioned below:
#crossvalidation
Hold Out Validation
K-fold Cross-Validation.
Stratified K-fold Cross-Validation
Leave One Out Cross-Validation.
Repeated Random Test-Train Splits

Using PyWebIO, developers can write applications just like writing terminal scripts (interaction based on input and print), without the need to have knowledge of HTML and JS. PyWebIO can also be easily integrated into existing Web services. PyWebIO is very suitable for quickly building applications that do not require complex UI.

R3zi7kSRuuI,Tutorial 4- Julia For Data Science-String In Julia Along With Indepth Functions,"github: https://github.com/krishnaik06/Julia-Programming-With-MAchine-Learning
Julia is a high-level, high-performance, dynamic programming language. While it is a general purpose language and can be used to write any application, many of its features are well-suited for numerical analysis and computational science
Distinctive aspects of Julia's design include a type system with parametric polymorphism in a dynamic programming language; with multiple dispatch as its core programming paradigm. Julia supports concurrent, (composable) parallel and distributed computing (with or without using MPI and/or the built-in corresponding[clarification needed][20] to ""OpenMP-style"" threads), 
and direct calling of C and Fortran libraries without glue code. Julia uses a just-in-time (JIT) compiler that is referred to as ""just-ahead-of-time"" (JAOT) in the Julia community, as Julia compiles (on default settings) to machine code before running it.

Julia is a high-level, high-performance, dynamic programming language. While it is a general purpose language and can be used to write any application, many of its features are well-suited for numerical analysis and computational science
Distinctive aspects of Julia's design include a type system with parametric polymorphism in a dynamic programming language; with multiple dispatch as its core programming paradigm. Julia supports concurrent, (composable) parallel and distributed computing (with or without using MPI and/or the built-in corresponding[clarification needed][20] to ""OpenMP-style"" threads), 
and direct calling of C and Fortran libraries without glue code. Julia uses a just-in-time (JIT) compiler that is referred to as ""just-ahead-of-time"" (JAOT) in the Julia community, as Julia compiles (on default settings) to machine code before running it.

So far, in our experience while providing training for data science and while interviewing candidates, we have observed that one of  the things which is most lacking is the intuition and experience to build an end to end machine learning pipeline and architecture.
Hence, we are launching this initiative to discuss various architectures catering to almost all the software industry domains. Here, we will drill down to the nitty-gritty of building a software solution from scratch and discuss various ways to make it scalable and robust. Moreover, we’ll also talk about building your resumes for data science job roles based on your experience and the industry domain that you work in.

Some algorithms do support multioutput regression inherently, such as linear regression and decision trees. There are also special workaround models that can be used to wrap and use those algorithms that do not natively support predicting multiple outputs.

NAPhUDjgG_s,Tutorial 28-MultiCollinearity In Linear Regression- Part 2,"In regression, ""multicollinearity"" refers to predictors that are correlated with other predictors.

This type of recommender system is dependent on the inputs provided by the user. Some of the typical examples of content based filtering are Google, Wikipedia etc. Let’s start by getting an intuition of what these recommenders do. When you search a group of keywords, the most basic idea will be to show all the items containing those keywords

CKLwvuKWQjo,Tutorial 14- Stochastic Gradient Descent with Momentum,"In this post I’ll talk about simple addition to classic SGD algorithm, called momentum which almost always works better and faster than Stochastic Gradient Descent. Momentum or SGD with momentum is method which helps accelerate gradients vectors in the right directions, thus leading to faster converging. It is one of the most popular optimization algorithms and many state-of-the-art models are trained using it. Before jumping over to the update equations of the algorithm, let’s look at some math that underlies the work of momentum.

wTF6vzS9fy4,K Nearest Neighbour Easily Explained with Implementation,"In pattern recognition, the k-nearest neighbors algorithm (k-NN) is a non-parametric method used for classification and regression.[1] In both cases, the input consists of the k closest training examples in the feature space. The output depends on whether k-NN is used for classification or regression:

In k-NN classification, the output is a class membership. An object is classified by a plurality vote of its neighbors, with the object being assigned to the class most common among its k nearest neighbors (k is a positive integer, typically small). If k = 1, then the object is simply assigned to the class of that single nearest neighbor.
In k-NN regression, the output is the property value for the object. This value is the average of the values of k nearest neighbors.
k-NN is a type of instance-based learning, or lazy learning, where the function is only approximated locally and all computation is deferred until classification. The k-NN algorithm is among the simplest of all machine learning algorithms.

Both for classification and regression, a useful technique can be used to assign weight to the contributions of the neighbors, so that the nearer neighbors contribute more to the average than the more distant ones. For example, a common weighting scheme consists in giving each neighbor a weight of 1/d, where d is the distance to the neighbor.
